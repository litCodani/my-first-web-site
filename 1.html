<p>It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality.</p> 
<p>It is now considered an official web standard.</p> 
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates. 
The average website includes several different HTML pages. 
For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.
HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. 
A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.
All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. 
HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. 
A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, 
whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element.
